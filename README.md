# country-slice

My small hobby toy project, written in Rust language with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)'s ECS and OpenGL. Still **active WIP**!

### Build and Run

1. download the repo
2. cd to the `country-slice` directory
3. execute `cargo run --release`, this will build and run the app
